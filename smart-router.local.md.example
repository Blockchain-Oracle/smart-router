# Smart Router User Preferences
# Copy this file to .claude/smart-router.local.md in your project

# ========================================
# ROUTING BEHAVIOR
# ========================================

routingMode: context
# Options:
#   auto     - Always pick best tool automatically (fastest, no questions)
#   ask      - Always show ranked menu and let you choose (most control)
#   context  - Use file context to auto-decide, show brief reasoning (balanced)
#
# Recommendation: Start with 'context', switch to 'auto' once comfortable

# ========================================
# DISPLAY OPTIONS
# ========================================

showReasoning: true
# Show why a tool was chosen
# Set to false for minimal output (just "Routing to X")

# ========================================
# EXCLUSIONS
# ========================================

excludePlugins: []
# Plugins to never suggest
# Example:
# excludePlugins:
#   - ralph-wiggum
#   - old-deprecated-plugin

# ========================================
# PRIORITY OVERRIDES
# ========================================

priorityOrder: []
# Prefer these plugins in this order (overrides default ranking)
# Example:
# priorityOrder:
#   - superpowers
#   - pr-review-toolkit
#   - bmad

# ========================================
# CONTEXT RULES (ADVANCED)
# ========================================

contextRules: []
# Override routing for specific file patterns
# Example:
# contextRules:
#   - filePattern: "*.unity"
#     preferPlugins: ["bmad"]
#   - filePattern: "*.test.ts"
#     preferPlugins: ["superpowers"]

# User Preference Examples

## Example 1: Always Auto-Route (Fastest)
```yaml
---
routingMode: auto
showReasoning: false
---
```
Result: Smart Router picks best tool and uses it immediately, no output

## Example 2: Always Ask (Most Control)
```yaml
---
routingMode: ask
showReasoning: true
---
```
Result: Always shows ranked menu, you choose which tool

## Example 3: Prefer Superpowers
```yaml
---
routingMode: context
priorityOrder:
  - superpowers
---
```
Result: Superpowers tools ranked first when available

## Example 4: Game Development Workflow
```yaml
---
routingMode: auto
priorityOrder:
  - bmad
contextRules:
  - filePattern: "*.unity"
    preferPlugins: ["bmad"]
  - filePattern: "*.cs"
    preferPlugins: ["bmad"]
---
```
Result: Auto-routes to BMAD for all game development files

## Example 5: Exclude Experimental Plugins
```yaml
---
routingMode: context
excludePlugins:
  - experimental-plugin
  - beta-tool
---
```
Result: Never suggests excluded plugins

# Installation

1. Copy this file:
```bash
cp smart-router.local.md.example .claude/smart-router.local.md
```

2. Edit `.claude/smart-router.local.md` with your preferences

3. Restart Claude Code session (or just continue - settings load on next routing)

# Notes

- Settings file is optional - defaults work well for most users
- File must be in `.claude/` directory (project-specific)
- Add `.claude/*.local.md` to .gitignore (don't commit personal preferences)
- Changes take effect immediately on next routing decision
