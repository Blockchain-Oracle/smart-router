# Configure Smart Router

Interactive setup for Smart Router user preferences. Creates or updates `.claude/smart-router.local.md` with your routing preferences.

## What This Does

Guides you through configuring:
1. **Routing mode** - How Smart Router selects tools (auto/ask/context)
2. **Display options** - Show reasoning for decisions
3. **Priority order** - Preferred plugin order
4. **Exclusions** - Plugins to never suggest

Creates `.claude/smart-router.local.md` with your choices.

## Process

### Step 1: Check for Existing Settings

First, check if settings file already exists:

```bash
.claude/smart-router.local.md
```

If it exists:
- Read current settings
- Show them to user
- Ask: "Update existing settings or start fresh?"

### Step 2: Ask Configuration Questions

Use AskUserQuestion tool to collect preferences interactively.

**Question 1: Routing Mode**

```
How should Smart Router select tools?

Options:
1. auto - Always pick best automatically (fastest, no questions)
   Best for: Users who trust the routing logic

2. ask - Always show ranked menu (most control)
   Best for: Users who want to choose every time

3. context - Use file context to auto-decide, show brief reasoning (balanced)
   Best for: Most users (recommended)

Which mode do you prefer?
```

**Question 2: Show Reasoning**

```
Show reasoning when routing to a tool?

Options:
1. yes - Show why tool was chosen (helpful for learning)
2. no - Minimal output (just route and go)

Show reasoning?
```

**Question 3: Priority Order** (optional)

```
Set preferred plugin order? (optional)

If you always prefer certain plugins, list them in order.
Otherwise, Smart Router uses specialty + context ranking.

Examples:
- "superpowers, pr-review-toolkit"
- "bmad, superpowers"
- Leave empty to skip

Enter plugin names (comma-separated) or press Enter to skip:
```

**Question 4: Exclude Plugins** (optional)

```
Exclude any plugins from suggestions? (optional)

List plugins you never want suggested.

Examples:
- "ralph-wiggum, old-plugin"
- Leave empty to skip

Enter plugin names (comma-separated) or press Enter to skip:
```

### Step 3: Validate Input

**Routing mode:**
- Must be: auto, ask, or context
- If invalid, ask again

**Show reasoning:**
- Must be: yes, no, true, false, y, n
- Convert to boolean

**Priority order:**
- Split by comma
- Trim whitespace
- Validate plugin names exist (check registry if available)
- Warn if plugin not found, but allow it

**Exclude plugins:**
- Same validation as priority order

### Step 4: Generate Settings File

Create `.claude/smart-router.local.md`:

```yaml
---
# Smart Router Configuration
# Generated by /smart-router:configure on [DATE]

routingMode: [user-choice]

showReasoning: [true/false]

priorityOrder: [plugin-list or empty array]

excludePlugins: [plugin-list or empty array]

# Advanced: Context rules (edit manually if needed)
contextRules: []
---

# Smart Router User Preferences

This file was auto-generated. You can edit it manually or re-run `/smart-router:configure`.

## Current Settings

**Routing Mode:** [mode]
- [Explanation of what this mode does]

**Show Reasoning:** [yes/no]

**Priority Order:** [list or "None - using default ranking"]

**Exclude Plugins:** [list or "None"]

## To Reconfigure

Run `/smart-router:configure` again to update settings interactively.

## Manual Editing

You can also edit this file directly. See `smart-router.local.md.example` for all available options.
```

### Step 5: Write File and Confirm

1. Ensure `.claude/` directory exists:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude
```

2. Write settings file using Write tool

3. Show confirmation:
```
✅ Smart Router Configuration Saved

Settings saved to: .claude/smart-router.local.md

Your preferences:
- Routing mode: [mode]
- Show reasoning: [yes/no]
- Priority order: [list or "None"]
- Exclude plugins: [list or "None"]

Settings will take effect on the next routing decision.

To reconfigure: /smart-router:configure
To view settings: cat .claude/smart-router.local.md
```

## Examples

### Example 1: First-time Setup

```
You: /smart-router:configure

Smart Router: No existing settings found. Let's set up your preferences.

[Questions...]

User selections:
- Mode: context
- Reasoning: yes
- Priority: superpowers
- Exclude: none

Smart Router: ✅ Configuration saved to .claude/smart-router.local.md
```

### Example 2: Update Existing Settings

```
You: /smart-router:configure

Smart Router: Found existing settings:
- Routing mode: auto
- Show reasoning: true
- Priority order: superpowers, bmad

Update existing settings or start fresh?
(update/fresh): update

[Shows current values in questions, user can keep or change...]

Smart Router: ✅ Configuration updated
```

### Example 3: Quick Setup (Auto Mode)

```
You: /smart-router:configure

[User selects:]
- Mode: auto
- Reasoning: no
- Priority: (skip)
- Exclude: (skip)

Result: Minimal settings file, fully automatic routing
```

## Implementation Notes

**Use AskUserQuestion tool** for interactive prompts:
- One question at a time (don't overwhelm)
- Provide clear options
- Show examples
- Allow skipping optional settings

**Validate all inputs:**
- Routing mode must be valid
- Plugin names should exist (warn if not found)
- Boolean values normalized

**File safety:**
- Backup existing file before overwriting
- Use Write tool (not bash redirection)
- Ensure proper YAML syntax

**Error handling:**
- If `.claude/` is not writable, show error
- If settings file exists and user cancels, don't modify
- If invalid plugin names, warn but allow

After configuration, test by running a routing scenario:
```
"I need a code review"
```

Smart Router should now use your configured preferences.
